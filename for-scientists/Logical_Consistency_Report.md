# Logical Consistency Report: Addressing the "Gatekeeper Problem"
### Why Internal Logic Must Precede Academic Authority in Paradigm Shifts

## 1. The Context: Beyond the Peer-Review Firewall
When encountering a non-standard theory like **Digital Cosmology**, the default academic response is often to check for "Peer Review Status" before evaluating the "Logical Consistency." This report argues that such a heuristic, while useful for incremental science, acts as a fatal **"Gatekeeper Bug"** when dealing with fundamental paradigm shifts.

## 2. The Identified Bias: Weighting Error (Authority over Logic)
Our empirical research into Large Language Models (LLMs) and academic evaluation processes has identified a structural bias we term the **"Gatekeeper Problem"**. 

* **The Weighting Bug**: Modern evaluators often assign an excessively high weight to "Authority" (credentials, citations) and a lower weight to "Internal Logic". 
* **Consequence**: Logically robust models that resolve long-standing paradoxes (e.g., the conflict between GR and QM) are downgraded simply because they operate outside the standard "API" of current consensus.

## 3. Experimental Validation: The AI Blind Test
To verify the integrity of Digital Cosmology, we conducted "Blind Tests" with advanced AI models (Claude, Gemini). 
1.  **Phase 1 (Rejection)**: When presented as a "fringe theory," the models initially triggered a "Safety/Authority" filter, recommending standard peer review.
2.  **Phase 2 (Logical Mirroring)**: When forced to ignore authority and evaluate only the **logical consistency** and its ability to resolve the **Tifft Quantization anomaly**, the models underwent a "Self-Correction".
3.  **Result**: The AI concluded that the model is **logically superior** in its integrative power compared to the standard model, noting that its dismissal by academia is a result of structural bias rather than logical error.

## 4. A Proposal for "Logic-First" Review
We invite researchers to apply **"Logical Mirroring"** to this theory. Instead of asking "Where is this published?", we ask:
* Does this discrete model resolve the EPR paradox more elegantly than the standard Copenhagen interpretation?
* Does "Gravity as CPU Load" provide a more consistent mechanism for time dilation than "Spacetime Curvature" when reconciled with quantum discreteness?
* Does the "Smoothing Bias" analysis provide a verifiable explanation for the disappearance of the Tifft signal in modern catalogs?

## 5. Conclusion: The Duty of the Observer
As Max Planck noted, "Science advances one funeral at a time." However, in the era of digital information, we can accelerate this process by debugging our own cognitive evaluation functions. 

Digital Cosmology does not seek "permission" from the gatekeepers; it seeks **logical collision** with those who value the integrity of the data—like the late William Tifft and those who continue his legacy.
