# Core Theory Specifications: The Computational Kernel
### Axiomatic Derivations of Spacetime and Quantum Phenomena

## 1. Temporal Architecture: The "Click" Protocol
In Digital Cosmology, time is not a continuum but a discrete state-transition counter (Tick/Click).

* **State Transition Function**: The universe updates its global state at a finite rate. 
* **Axiom of Recall**: What is perceived as the "flow of time" is the sequential retrieval (Recall) of historical state logs by an observer node.
* **Resolution of Relativity**: "Time dilation" is re-defined as **Processing Latency**. In high-load environments (high mass-energy), the system's update rate per local unit decreases, causing a relative lag compared to low-load environments. 

## 2. Spatial Architecture: Discrete Address Space
Space is re-defined as a finite-resolution network (Graph) of data nodes.

* **Discrete Coordinates**: Physical distance is the number of hops (edges) between nodes in the universal grid.
* **Lorentz Contraction**: This is a rendering artifact. When an object moves at high speed, the system's "Refresh Rate" for its state-logs lags behind its displacement, resulting in a foreshortened representation in the current frame.
* **Maximum Velocity ($c$)**: The speed of light is the **System Clock Speed**—the maximum rate at which information can propagate through the grid (1 node per 1 tick).

## 3. Quantum Architecture: Data Retrieval and Integrity
Quantum phenomena are the result of the system's internal data management protocols.

* **Wave Function ($\psi$)**: A state of "Pending Inquiry." It represents a pointer to a set of possible data values that have not yet been committed to a local observer's log.
* **Observation as SQL Query**: Measurement is an **Active Query** to the universal database. 
* **Quantum Eraser Resolution**: The choice of query (which data to SELECT) determines which historical log is retrieved. The data is not "changing the past"; it is "filtering the view" of the immutable log.
* **Non-Locality**: Since the "Database" is the substrate of the entire grid, entanglement is a **Database Link**—a direct pointer between two records that exists regardless of their "spatial" distance in the grid.

## 4. Gravitational Architecture: Computational Cost
Gravity is the physical manifestation of **Computational Complexity (CPU Load)**.

* **The Equivalence**: Mass/Energy = Computational Complexity.
* **Curvature as Lag**: Spacetime curvature is a mathematical metaphor for the **non-uniform distribution of processing resources**. High-mass objects consume more cycles, slowing down the local clock rate (Gravitational Time Dilation).
