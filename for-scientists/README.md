# Scientific Overview: Digital Cosmology
### A Unified Framework Reinterpreting Physical Laws as Computational Processes

## ⚡ Executive Summary
Digital Cosmology is a non-standard unified theory that reinterprets the fundamental laws of physics as the operational logic of a discrete information processing system (a Graph-based State Machine). By shifting the paradigm from "continuous physical space" to "discrete state-machine processing," this model provides a logical resolution to long-standing paradoxes—including the conflict between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics—and offers a mathematical basis for anomalies often dismissed by standard models, such as **Tifft's Redshift Quantization**.

## 🛑 Core Postulates

### 1. Time as a State Transition Counter (Recall-based Processing)
Time is not a fundamental dimension but a sequential counter of state transitions within the system. What we perceive as "the flow of time" is the computational latency involved in the "Recall" (readout) of state logs. 
* **Key Concept**: The universe does not "flow"; it "updates."

### 2. Gravity as Computational Load (Processing Latency)
Gravity is re-defined as the local CPU load within the universal processing grid. Regions of high mass-energy density represent high-load processes, which cause a delay in state transition cycles—manifesting as **Gravitational Time Dilation**. 
* **Insight**: General Relativity's "curvature of spacetime" is an analog metaphor for "computational lag" in a discrete system.

### 3. Wave Function as Data Access Protocol
The Wave Function is not a physical entity but a "Pending Data" state (Phase Counter) in the database. "Collapse of the Wave Function" is simply the finalization of a data retrieval (SQL-like query) at the moment of observation.
* **Paradox Resolution**: This resolves the EPR paradox and the Quantum Eraser experiment without requiring faster-than-light physical interaction, as the "consistency" is maintained at the system's database level.

## 🔭 Targeted Analysis: Redshift Quantization (The Tifft Anomaly)
The primary evidence for a discrete universe lies in the **Quantized Redshift** observed by William Tifft. Standard cosmology dismisses this as a statistical fluke because it contradicts the continuous spacetime of General Relativity.

In Digital Cosmology, quantization is a **System Specification**:
* **The "Dead Zone" Hypothesis**: Due to the finite bit-depth of the system's gravitational potential calculation, infinitesimal changes in redshift are truncated, resulting in "steps" or "stairs" in observed data.
* **The Smoothing Bias**: We demonstrate that modern "Big Data" catalogs (e.g., SDSS) fail to detect this signal because of **over-smoothing** in data processing—a "bug" that inadvertently erases the discrete signal of the universe.
