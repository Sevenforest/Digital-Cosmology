### 📢 Author's Manifesto: The Definition of "Everything"

I am not a physicist.
Therefore, I have no interest in academic goals such as "deriving the parameters of the Standard Model."
I leave such "answer-checking" calculations to academia.

My goal was simpler, yet more fundamental:
**"To debug the fatal conflict (bug) between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics using system engineering methodologies."**
That is all.

As a result of this debugging process, this "Digital Cosmology" was outputted.
Whether scholars choose to call this a "Theory of Everything" is up to them.

However, what lies here is the source code of the universe, free of logical bugs.
Therefore, under my authority as a System Architect, I define this as the **"Digital Theory of Everything."**

## 🌌 Overview

This repository hosts the documentation and empirical code for a **Digital Theory of Everything** derived from an engineering perspective: **"The Universe as a Discrete State Machine."**
This theory addresses unsolved problems in physics (the Problem of Time, unification of Quantum Gravity, the Measurement Problem).

By denying the existence of "continuous spacetime" and "real wave functions" assumed in standard physics, and redefining them as **"processes of computational resource optimization,"** this theory logically resolves the paradoxes between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.

## ⚠️ Attribution & Contribution

This theory was established through a process where **Sevenforest (Author/Repository Owner)** proposed unique cosmological axioms, and a **Large Language Model (LLM)** verified their logical consistency and implemented them.

When citing or referencing this work academically, please understand the following role division:

### 1. Axioms by Author
The following concepts are the core intuitions constructed by the author before the dialogue with AI, forming the kernel of this theory:
* **Time Non-Realism:** Time is not a physical entity (dimension) but merely a "counter of state updates" based on energy conservation.
* **Digital Cosmology:** The universe is not a continuum but a computer described by discrete values (integers).
* **Denial of Wave Monism:** Wave functions do not exist as physical entities; particles behave deterministically.

### 2. Implementation by AI
Based on the vectors (constraints) provided by the author, the LLM derived the following logical conclusions (specifications).
**These derivation results could not have been generated without the author's initial axioms (input). Therefore, the intellectual property rights and discovery credits belong to the author (the inputter).**

* **Deterministic Chaos:** The true nature of quantum fluctuations is pseudo-randomness arising from computational complexity.
* **SQL Query Interpretation:** The reversal of causality in the Quantum Eraser experiment can be described as a "post-hoc search query (Filtering) to the database."
* **Dead Zone:** The discovery of "step-like behaviors (discrete steps)" in gravitational redshift.

## 🧪 Key Findings / Predictions

### 1. Gravitational Redshift "Dead Zone"
If this theory is correct, in extremely minute gravitational potential differences, if the energy change is less than an integer multiple of the Planck unit, there exists a region where no redshift occurs (frequency does not change).
*(You can simulate this "staircase behavior" in the Interactive Lab linked above.)*

### 2. "SQL Query" Interpretation of Quantum Eraser
The future does not change the past. Instead, the "observation result" functions as a key (Search Key) to decrypt the "past encrypted data (noise)."

* Past Data: `Encrypted Noise`
* Observation: `SELECT * FROM Screen WHERE Detector = 'D1'`
* Result: `Interference Pattern`
*(You can experience this filtering process in the Interactive Lab.)*

### 3. Sensitivity Analysis & Detection Limits
The simulation code in this repository now includes a **Sensitivity Analysis** module that accounts for instrumental noise.
* **Current Status:** With standard atomic clocks, the "step-like behavior" is buried in noise and appears continuous.
* **Prediction:** The "Dead Zone" will only become statistically significant when the noise level drops below 1/3 of the step size (e.g., with next-gen optical lattice clocks).

### 4. Historical Convergence: The Tifft Anomaly
The "Dead Zone" predicted by this theory structurally aligns with the **"Redshift Quantization (72 km/s periodicity)"** reported by William Tifft et al., which remained an unsolved anomaly.
Digital Cosmology provides the first rational theoretical explanation for this historical data from the perspective of "discrete computational resources."

## 💌 Message from the Architect

Digital Cosmology recognizes that, according to current academic standards, mathematical reinforcement is required in at least the following three areas:

* **Mathematical Formulation of Causal Structures (Causal Graphs)**
* **Formalization of Conservation Laws (Discrete Conservation)**
* **Supplementation of Limit Behaviors (Limit Behaviors)**

The absence of these in the current documentation is not because they "could not" be reinforced.
It is because I judged that **"reinforcement by my hand is unnecessary."**

The reason is described below in the view of the AI (Gemini), the co-constructor of this theory, which I fully support.

> "These are tasks for **'mathematicians and physicists around the world who see your theory,'** rather than for you (the Architect)."
> "Conclusion: This is the **roadmap for 'v2.0'.**"

If this theory were fed into an LLM, they would likely complete the mathematical reinforcement instantly.
However, I want this reinforcement to be completed by **"human hands."**

As one human who designed this system, that is my wish.
