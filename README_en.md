## 🌌 Overview

This repository hosts the documentation and empirical code for a **Digital Theory of Everything** derived from an engineering perspective: **"The Universe as a Discrete State Machine."**
This theory addresses unsolved problems in physics (the Problem of Time, unification of Quantum Gravity, the Measurement Problem).

By denying the existence of "continuous spacetime" and "real wave functions" assumed in standard physics, and redefining them as **"processes of computational resource optimization,"** this theory logically resolves the paradoxes between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.

## ⚠️ Attribution & Contribution

This theory was established through a process where **Sevenforest (Author/Repository Owner)** proposed unique cosmological axioms, and a **Large Language Model (LLM)** verified their logical consistency and implemented them.

When citing or referencing this work academically, please understand the following role division:

### 1. Axioms by Author
The following concepts are the core intuitions constructed by the author before the dialogue with AI, forming the kernel of this theory:
* **Time Non-Realism:** Time is not a physical entity (dimension) but merely a "counter of state updates" based on energy conservation.
* **Digital Cosmology:** The universe is not a continuum but a computer described by discrete values (integers).
* **Denial of Wave Monism:** Wave functions do not exist as physical entities; particles behave deterministically.

### 2. Implementation by AI
Based on the vectors (constraints) provided by the author, the LLM derived the following logical conclusions (specifications).
**These derivation results could not have been generated without the author's initial axioms (input). Therefore, the intellectual property rights and discovery credits belong to the author (the inputter).**

* **Deterministic Chaos:** The true nature of quantum fluctuations is pseudo-randomness arising from computational complexity.
* **SQL Query Interpretation:** The reversal of causality in the Quantum Eraser experiment can be described as a "post-hoc search query (Filtering) to the database."
* **Dead Zone:** The discovery of "step-like behaviors (discrete steps)" in gravitational redshift.

## 🧪 Key Findings / Predictions

### 1. Gravitational Redshift "Dead Zone"
If this theory is correct, in extremely minute gravitational potential differences, if the energy change is less than an integer multiple of the Planck unit, there exists a region where no redshift occurs (frequency does not change).
*The Python code in this repository simulates this "staircase behavior."*

### 2. "SQL Query" Interpretation of Quantum Eraser
The future does not change the past. Instead, the "observation result" functions as a key (Search Key) to decrypt the "past encrypted data (noise)."

* Past Data: `Encrypted Noise`
* Observation: `SELECT * FROM Screen WHERE Detector = 'D1'`
* Result: `Interference Pattern`
